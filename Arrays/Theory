1) Use TreeSet(O(n logn)) instead of HashSet if you want to remove duplicates and maintain the order of the elements.
2) But using LinkedHashSet(O(n)) would maintain the order and even reduce the complexity of the code.
3) When ever get the keyword Sorted List, keep in mind for two-pointers pattern
4) Reverse array prob;em - learn how to optimise SPACE complexity.
5) While rotating, try using in place rotation without using another array, sor this you can use two pointer (reverse right questions)

1) <LinkedHashSet> would maintain the order not ascending order but <TreeSet> maintain ascending order without duplicates.

1) HashSet is better in terms of complexity than arraylist so make use of hashset or LinkedHashSet or treeset instead of arraylist (MISSING NUMBER LC268)
2)
