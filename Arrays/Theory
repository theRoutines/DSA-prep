1) Use TreeSet(O(n logn)) instead of HashSet if you want to remove duplicates and maintain the order of the elements.
2) But using LinkedHashSet(O(n)) would maintain the order and even reduce the complexity of the code.
3) When ever get the keyword Sorted List, keep in mind for two-pointers pattern
4) Reverse array prob;em - learn how to optimise SPACE complexity.
